You are given a list of strings dictionary and are playing a game called Ghost. 
Ghost is a two-person word game where players alternate appending letters to a string. 
The string being made must be a valid prefix of a word in the dictionary, and the first 
person who spells out any word in the dictionary loses.
Return whether the first player would win if both players are playing optimally.
Constraints
* n â‰¤ 10,000 where n is the length of dictionary.

Example 1
Input
words = ["ghost", "ghostbuster", "gas"]
Output
false
Explanation
Here is a sample game when dictionary is ["ghost", "ghostbuster", "gas"]:
* Player 1: "g"
* Player 2: "h"
* Player 1: "o"
* Player 2: "s"
* Player 1: "t" [loses]
If player 2 had chosen "a" as the second letter, player 1 would still lose since they'd be forced to write the last letter "s".
